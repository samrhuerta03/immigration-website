        <h3>Obama v. Trump</h3>
    </par>
    <div style="margin-left:50px;">
    <par>

    <p>
      <ul> President George W. Bush began the trend of a "Zero Tolerance" approach in 2005. </ul>

      <ul> Under President Barack Obama, the policy focused only on the deportation of immigrants who committed crimes in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security built family detention centers in Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Texas. Unaccompanied children were kept in holding cells, separated by age and gender, while appropriate placements were found. The government had to figure out how to handle the 2014 American immigration crisis (button), a surge of unaccompanied children and women fleeing violence in Central America, while also complying with the 1997 Flores v. Reno Settlement Agreement(button) consent decree by keeping families together. </ul>

     <ul>  Under Trump administration, the zero tolerance policy was extended to include all illegal immigrants regardless of their crime history in an effort to encourage tougher legislation regarding immigration. </ul>

 </p>

    <h5>Asylum Seekers At Border Crossings</h5>
  <par><ul> Asylum is a special type of immigration process reserved for people who have "suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion," according to USCIS.
Being granted asylum is not an easy feat. It's a multi-year process that involves likely detainment, multiple interviews, extensive documentation of an immigrant's prior suffering, and less than stellar odds.
</par></ul>
<par><ul>
It is not legal for the US to deny anyone the right to seek asylum without due diligence. However under the Trump administration, asylum seekers were denied at border crossings with inaccurate reasonings such as "the daily quota has been reached," that they needed to present a visa, or that they needed to schedule an appointment through Mexican authorities.
</par></ul>

  <p><h5>Family Separation:</h5></p>

  <par> <ul> It was announced that the US would be stricter when it comes to illegal crossings at the mexican borders. They decided to be stricter by separating the parents and children instead of them keeping them together at detention centers. </ul> </par>

  <par> <ul>  President Donald Trump blames the separation of families on his predecessor, President Barack Obama,  however there is clear evidence that this is not the case. This practice was the result of the Zero Tolerance Policy enacted by the Trump Administration. Although families were separated under Obama’s Administration, it was not as intense as under Trump’s Administration. </ul> </par>

  <par> <ul> Children are being greatly harmed due to the family separation. Children who are removed from their families are sent to shelters run by nongovernmental organizations. From there, workers try to find a guardian in the country that can take over the child’s care. If no adult is found, the child is guardianless. Most children lack a guardian because they arrive with improper papers. Many a time, children are lost in the system and when reuniting with their families, reunite with the wrong ones. </ul> </par>

  <par> <ul> Due to major disapproval from lawmakers from both parties, Immigration activists and the United Nations, Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June that attempted to end the practice of family separation. This did not get rid of the “Zero Tolerance” Policy, but said under Trump”s Administration, families must be kept together. </par> </u1>
