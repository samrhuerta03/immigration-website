          <h3>What is ICE?</h3>
      </par>
      <div style="margin-left:50px;">
      <par>

      <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) along with two other agencies: Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Citizenship Services. ICE was created in 2003 as a response to the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/9-11-attacks">Sept. 11 2001</a>, attacks. </p>
      </par>


      <h5>ICE Is Made Up Of Three Offices:</h5>
    <par>Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, Homeland Security Investigations, and Enforcement and Removal Operations.
    </par>
      <p><h5>Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA):</h5></p>
      <p><p>is the smallest division and is a legal program with over 1,100 attorneys. They represent the government during immigration courts. The attorneys provide support by prosecuting ICE cases and defending the ICE authorities in federal court. </p></p>

      <p><h5>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI):</h5> </p>

      <p><p>is the largest division and is the investigative component of DHS. HSI has broad legal authority to investigate all types of cross-border criminal activity such as drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human trafficking, cybercrimes, financial crimes, and identity fraud. It is also the lead government agency for counterproliferation investigations, and targets individuals who illegally attempt to smuggle military and other high-tech equipment out of the United States.</p></p>
      <par><h5>Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO):</par></h5>

      <p><p>is the best-known division of ICE and they are responsible for arresting, detaining, and deporting unauthorized immigrants who already reside in the United States. </p> </p>

          <par><h6>Under Barack Obama: the priority of the division was to remove unauthorized immigrants who have committed serious crimes in the country. </par></h6>

            <par><h6>
              Under Donald Trump: the division targeted all unauthorized immigrants under the so called Zero Tolerance Policy.
           </h6></par>

          <h3>What is Customs & Border Protection:</h3></par>
      <par> <p>Customs and Border Protection is an agency under the Department of Homeland Security alongside ICE. They are responsible for patrolling, monitoring and securing the United States’ borders with Mexico and Canada. Their job is to facilitate what goes in or out of the United States.</par></p>
    </div>
  <div align="left" class="container" width="500">
      <par><h3>“Zero Tolerance” Policy:</h3></par>

      <par><p>
          Under the trump administration, The Zero Tolerance Policy was extended to the prosecution of all  (i want a button here for definitions and stuff) who illegally enter or currently reside in the United States. Due to the policy, Customs & Border Protection agency is arresting and jailing adults, separating them from their children at the southwestern border. </p></par>

    <par><h3>Immigration Courts</h3></par>
    <par><p>
      <li>
          <ul>Immigration courts are civil courts therefore the federal court is not required to provide attorneys to the immigrant defendants. Thus the defendant must represent themselves.</ul>
          <ul>Only 37% of the defendants have some sort of representation in court.</ul>
          <ul>Children has to represent themselves.</ul>
          <ul>Immigration courts are a part of the executive branch, not the judicial.</ul>
          <ul>Deportation might turn out to be a death sentence.</ul>
          <ul>The courts SHOULD be fully independent from the DOJ.</ul>
          <ul>Crossing the border “the wrong way” is only a misdemeanor on first defense.</ul>
        </li>
    </p></par>
</div>


<div align="left" class="container" width="500">
<par>
    <h3>What Conservative Arguments Are:</h3></par>
<par> <p>

<ul> Crossing the border is a crime→ therefore anyone who does is a criminal→ all criminals are dangerous→ anybody crossing it is a dangerous criminal </ul>

<ul> Studies say that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit violent crimes than American-born citizens. </ul>

<ul> Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for government welfare benefits and legal immigrants only qualify for federal benefits once they've resided in the U.S. for five years. They are barred from food stamps, regular medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), according to the National Immigration Law Center. </ul>

    <h3>Why Do We Want To Abolish ICE? </h3></par>
<par> <p>

According to democratic lawmakers, liberal pundits, as well as popular opinion, ICE has become the symbol of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies according to democratic lawmakers.
